# Alignment Principles — Indonesian (ind), Old Testament

Guidelines used by `refine-alignment` when aligning Bible translations into Indonesian
against the Hebrew Old Testament (MACULA Hebrew / Westminster Leningrad Codex) source.

Sections marked **[ind]** contain Indonesian-specific rules or examples. Unmarked
sections follow the shared structural conventions of the English guidelines
(`alignment-principles-ot.md` and `prompt/ot/eng.py`).

Examples are grounded in Alkitab Terjemahan Baru (TBI) and checked against the actual
target TSV (Genesis 1:1-2, Genesis 2:23, Joshua 1:1, Judges 21:25, Psalm 23:1, Genesis
3:1) rather than constructed from general knowledge alone.

Source files: `src/text_align/refine/prompt/ot/ind.py`, `src/text_align/refine/prompt/ot/eng.py`

**Key differences from OT English:**

- No articles at all in the majority case — the Hebrew article word-part is
  overwhelmingly Branch B (absorbed with no target word), unlike English's
  near-obligatory "the"; "itu"/"ini" only for the minority anaphoric/demonstrative case,
  parallel to NT Indonesian.
- Fused possessive/object clitics (-ku/-mu/-nya) attach directly to noun, preposition, or
  verb as ONE target token — both the head token and the pronominal-suffix word-part are
  primary, sharing that one token (same mechanism as NT Indonesian).
- No indefinite article (bare noun default).
- **Construct chains** are the standout structural difference: Indonesian forms
  possession/genitive by bare noun-noun juxtaposition in the SAME head-then-modifier
  order Hebrew already uses (rumah Tuhan = "house LORD" = בֵּית יְהוָה) — no linking word
  is needed at all, unlike English "of" or French "de". "dari" only appears when it
  corresponds to an actual Hebrew מִן ("from") preposition token (source/partitive
  sense), never as a supplied construct-chain marker.
- Simple contiguous negation (tidak/jangan + verb), no discontinuous structure; existential
  אֵין renders as the fixed "tidak ada" phrase.
- "yang" pattern for substantive participles, with or without an explicit head noun
  ("orang(-orang)"), matching NT Indonesian exactly.
- No distinct infinitive marker (bare verb primary, unlike English "to"); the בְּ+infinitive
  temporal construction renders as an ordinary finite clause with "ketika"/"saat", not a
  nonfinite form — the same mechanism NT Indonesian uses for ἐν τῷ + infinitive.

## ALIGNMENT DIRECTION

Alignments map translation → source: each record asks what Hebrew word(s) or word-part(s)
are behind this translation word.

---

## HEBREW WORD-PART TOKENS

MACULA Hebrew splits prefixed morphemes into separate word-part tokens, each with its own
BCVWP ID. Common word-parts:

- Inseparable prepositions (בְּ/לְ/כְּ/מִ) — pos=preposition
- Definite article (הַ/הָ/הֶ) — pos=particle
- Conjunction waw (וְ/וַ/וּ) — pos=conjunction
- Pronominal suffixes (וֹ, הוּ, ם, etc.) — pos=suffix

Word-part present → align Indonesian correspondent primary to that token.
No word-part (morpheme merged into main token) → align correspondent primary to the main
token.

---

## TOKEN ROLES **[ind]**

- **primary** — direct lexical or semantic connection to the Hebrew token
- **secondary** — exists because of Hebrew grammar with no separate source token
  (construct relation, verbal morphology, merged definiteness)
- correspondence to a different Hebrew token → separate record

**Structural constraints:** every record ≥1 primary per populated side; a lone token on
a side cannot be secondary; each target token ID in exactly one record per verse.

**Common secondary cases:**

- **Subject pronoun** — Indonesian verbs never inflect for person/number, but pronoun
  use is discourse-driven rather than grammar-driven: a pronoun is typically supplied
  when a clause introduces or switches to a new subject (common at waw-consecutive
  narrative transitions), and dropped when a coordinate clause continues the same topic.
  When present with no separate Hebrew pronoun token → secondary. When dropped (topic
  continuity) → none expected, leave unrecorded.
  Example: וַיֹּאמֶר → "lalu berkatalah" (introducing a new speech act, no repeated
  subject because context already establishes it): "lalu" primary (waw word-part);
  "berkatalah" primary (verb token). If a distinct subject noun follows, it gets its own
  record.
  Coordinate continuation (same subject as prior clause): no supplied pronoun — none
  expected.

- **No linking word for construct chain** — Indonesian juxtaposes head noun + modifier
  noun directly, matching Hebrew's own construct word order; no secondary "of"-equivalent
  is needed (see CONSTRUCT CHAINS).

- **No Indonesian article when merged** — no article word-part; the noun stands bare, no
  secondary needed (majority case, see ARTICLES).

- **Auxiliary verbs for participles** ("sedang duduk", "ada duduk") — main verb primary;
  auxiliary secondary.

- **Fused possessive/object clitic** — Indonesian's 1st/2nd/3rd-singular possessive and
  object pronouns (-ku, -mu, -nya) hyphenate directly onto the noun, preposition, or verb
  they attach to, forming ONE target token. When Hebrew expresses this with a
  pronominal-suffix word-part, BOTH the head token and the suffix word-part are primary,
  sharing the single fused target token. Plural suffixes (kami, kita, mereka) never fuse
  — they stay separate words and align as a normal 1:1 pair.
  Example: רֹעִי → "gembalaku": source=[רֹעִי-noun, sufPart], target=["gembalaku"] — both
  primary.
  Example: אֵלָיו → "kepadanya": source=[elPart, sufPart], target=["kepadanya"] — both
  primary.

- **Periphrastic rendering** — when a single Hebrew token is rendered by multiple
  Indonesian words, all words carrying lexical content are primary; purely grammatical
  connectors (relativizers, case markers) are secondary to the same token. Indonesian's
  rich verbal morphology (me-, memper-, ber-, ter-, di-) often does the reverse —
  rendering a Hebrew verb as a SINGLE Indonesian word where English needed a multi-word
  periphrasis; when that happens, align 1:1, no split needed.
  Examples: מָשַׁל → "menguasai" (primary 1:1; compare English "exercises dominion
  over," three words). שֹׁמֵר (substantive participle) → "yang menjaga": "menjaga"
  primary; "yang" secondary. הוֹדוּ → "mengucap syukur": both primary. הֵיטִיב →
  "berbuat baik": both primary.
  Hebrew niphal/pual/hophal (passive-voice stems) rendered with di-/ter- prefixes →
  single fused Indonesian token, primary 1:1, no separate auxiliary needed (contrast
  English "was created").

---

## NEQ (NON-EQUIVALENT) **[ind]**

NEQ is a positive claim that no correspondence exists — never a fallback for
uncertainty. Unrecorded means correspondence was not determined (normal). NEQ records
must not include `meta.secondary`.

- Certain no correspondent → NEQ (source or target empty, `meta.rel: "NEQ"`).
- Uncertain → leave unrecorded.

Hebrew direct object marker (אֶת/אֵת, pos=particle) → NEQ source in virtually all cases
(marks definite direct objects; no Indonesian equivalent). Rare exception: when
explicitly rendered "adapun" or similar topic-marking word.

Supplied copula ("adalah"/"ialah") with no Hebrew verb token → NEQ target (verbless
clause).
Example: יְהוָה רֹעִי → "Tuhan adalah gembalaku":
source=[יְהוָה], target=["Tuhan"] — primary;
source=[רֹעִי-noun, sufPart], target=["gembalaku"] — both primary (fused suffix);
"adalah" → NEQ target.

Waw conjunction + Indonesian asyndeton → waw word-part NEQ source.
Indonesian conjunction with no Hebrew conjunction token → NEQ target.

---

## SURFACE FORM DIFFERENCES

Tense, voice, number, aspect, and verbal stem (binyan) differences do not prevent
alignment. Align on lexical/semantic correspondence.

---

## GRANULARITY **[ind]**

Prefer one record per source token — split rather than group. Create separate records
whenever source tokens (or word-parts) can each independently map to distinct target
tokens. Combine into N:M records only when tokens form an inseparable semantic unit
(idiom) or target words cannot be individually assigned to separate source tokens. When
in doubt, split.

Leaving tokens unrecorded when no genuine correspondence exists is deliberate — not a
failure.

Grammar-required translation words (fused pronominal suffix, modal helpers for verbal
morphology ["bisa," "mungkin," "akan"], reinstated demonstrative) are secondary to the
source token or word-part whose grammar requires them — not NEQ. NEQ is for words with
no source-language grammatical anchor.

---

## ARTICLES **[ind]**

Hebrew article (הַ/הָ/הֶ) appears as a separate word-part token (pos=particle). Never NEQ.

**DEFAULT (most common in Indonesian) → Branch B:** no separate word at all — the noun
stands bare, and the article is secondary to the noun's own record with no target word
required. This is the majority case in Indonesian, unlike English's near-obligatory
"the".

**MINORITY case → Branch A:** primary 1:1, when the translation does supply a distinct
word.

### Branch A — article has a distinct Indonesian correspondent

- **→ "itu" (distal, anaphoric) or "ini" (proximal):** primary 1:1; noun in its own
  record. Typically appears on a SECOND or later mention of a referent, not the first.
  Example (first mention): הָאָרֶץ → "bumi" — no correspondent (Branch B, absorbed, no
  target word).
  Example (repeated/anaphoric mention): הָאָרֶץ → "bumi itu": source=[articlePart],
  target=["itu"] — primary 1:1; source=[אָרֶץ], target=["bumi"] — primary 1:1.

- **→ "orang"/"orang-orang" (substantive participle, generic head noun supplied):**
  article → primary 1:1; "yang" secondary to the participle.

### Branch B — no distinct Indonesian correspondent → secondary, no target word

- **Articular noun, bare in Indonesian:** source=[articlePart, אָרֶץ], target=["bumi"] —
  primary: "bumi"; secondary.source: [articlePart] (no target word needed).

- **Construct-chain absolute noun with article:** Indonesian juxtaposition already
  carries the construct-chain semantics; the article stays secondary with no separate
  word (see CONSTRUCT CHAINS).

### Anarthrous noun

No Hebrew article token exists, and Indonesian has no indefinite article — bare noun, no
secondary needed. Example: אִישׁ → "orang": primary alone.

---

## CONSTRUCT CHAINS **[ind]**

A construct chain expresses genitive by word order and construct form — no preposition
token. Indonesian forms possession the same way: bare noun-noun juxtaposition, head noun
first, exactly matching Hebrew's own construct order. No linking word is needed — this
differs from every Indo-European target config, which requires an explicit "of"/"de"/"do"
secondary.

Example: בֵּית יְהוָה → "rumah Tuhan":
source=[בֵּית], target=["rumah"] — primary 1:1 (no secondary needed);
source=[יְהוָה], target=["Tuhan"] — primary 1:1.

Example: מֹשֶׁה עֶבֶד־יְהוָה → "Musa hamba Tuhan":
source=[מֹשֶׁה], target=["Musa"] — primary 1:1;
source=[עֶבֶד], target=["hamba"] — primary 1:1 (no secondary needed);
source=[יְהוָה], target=["Tuhan"] — primary 1:1.

Do NOT expect or supply a secondary "dari" for a bare construct relationship. "dari" is
reserved for an actual Hebrew מִן ("from") preposition token expressing source or
partitive sense — never a supplied construct-chain marker.

Example: עֶצֶם מֵעֲצָמַי → "tulang dari tulangku" (מִן preposition present, not a bare
construct):
source=[עֶצֶם], target=["tulang"] — primary 1:1;
source=[minPrepPart], target=["dari"] — primary 1:1;
source=[עֶצֶם, sufPart], target=["tulangku"] — both primary (fused suffix).

Construct definiteness: Hebrew article word-part on the absolute noun stays secondary
per ARTICLES Branch B — Indonesian's own juxtaposition already signals the relationship,
so no extra word is needed even when the article marks the whole chain as definite.

---

## INSEPARABLE PREPOSITIONS **[ind]**

Preposition word-part → Indonesian preposition (di/ke/dari/dengan/seperti): primary 1:1.
Merged article in the same token has no separate Indonesian correspondent (Indonesian
has no article) — no secondary needed beyond the ordinary Branch B treatment.

Example: בַּשָּׁמַיִם → "di langit" (single merged token, article absorbed):
source=[bashamayimId], target=["di", "langit"] — primary: "di", "langit".

---

## CONJUNCTIONS AND PARTICLES **[ind]**

Align content words first; conjunctions and particles are residual.

- Waw word-part (pos=conjunction) → "dan"/"tetapi"/"lalu"/"maka"/"sebab": primary.
  Asyndeton → NEQ source.
- כִּי — polyfunctional; align to whichever Indonesian word carries its force in context
  ("bahwa", "sebab", "karena"). Introducing direct speech with only punctuation → NEQ
  source.
- אֲשֶׁר/שֶׁ — "yang" (universal relativizer): primary. Absorbed without correspondent →
  NEQ source.

---

## IDIOMS **[ind]**

`meta.is_idiom: true` when phrase-level correspondence has no token-level equivalent.
All tokens implicitly primary; `meta.secondary` does not apply.

Last resort — always prefer standard records, even with loose primary matches. Use idiom
only when no plausible token-level decomposition exists. Function-word-only source units
are never idioms — they have individual correspondences or NEQ determinations.

---

## PRONOMINAL SUFFIXES **[ind]**

Pronominal suffixes are separate word-part tokens (pos=suffix). Singular suffixes (-ku,
-mu, -nya) fuse directly onto the noun, preposition, or verb they attach to, forming ONE
Indonesian token — BOTH the head token and the suffix word-part are primary, sharing that
single fused token (same mechanism as NT Indonesian's fused-clitic rule). Plural suffixes
(kami, kita, kalian, mereka) never fuse — they stay separate words and align as a normal
1:1 pair.

- **Possessive suffix on noun (singular, fused):** both tokens primary to the one fused
  word.
  Example: דְּבָרוֹ → "firman-Nya"/"perkataannya": source=[davarPart],
  target=["perkataannya"] — primary; source=[sufPart], target=["perkataannya"] — primary
  (same token, both primary).
  Plural possessive (no fusion): source=[sufPart], target=["mereka"] — primary 1:1;
  source=[davarPart], target=["perkataan"] — primary 1:1.

- **Object suffix on verb (singular, fused):** both tokens primary to the one fused word.
  Example: שְׁמָרַנִי → "menjagaku": source=[shamarPart], target=["menjagaku"] — primary;
  source=[niPart], target=["menjagaku"] — primary (same token, both primary).
  Plural object (no fusion): שְׁמָרֵנוּ → "menjaga kami": source=[shamarPart],
  target=["menjaga"] — primary 1:1; source=[nuPart], target=["kami"] — primary 1:1.

- **Suffix on preposition (singular, fused):** both tokens primary to the one fused word.
  Example: אֵלָיו → "kepadanya": source=[elPart], target=["kepadanya"] — primary;
  source=[sufPart], target=["kepadanya"] — primary (same token, both primary).

---

## NEGATION **[ind]**

Indonesian negation is simple and contiguous (tidak/jangan + verb) — unlike languages
with discontinuous negation, and there is usually no separate auxiliary to
secondary-mark.

- לֹא/לוֹא → "tidak" (indicative): primary 1:1. Verb gets its own record.
  Example: לֹא יֵדַע → "tidak tahu": source=[loId], target=["tidak"] — primary 1:1;
  source=[verbId], target=["tahu"] — primary 1:1.

- אַל (jussive/imperative) → "jangan": primary 1:1.
  Example: אַל תֹּאכְלוּ → "jangan kamu makan": source=[alId], target=["jangan"] —
  primary 1:1; source=[verbId], target=["kamu", "makan"] — primary: "makan"; secondary:
  "kamu" (supplied subject pronoun).

- אֵין/אַיִן (existential) → "tidak ada": fixed phrase, both words primary 1:N.
  Example: אֵין מֶלֶךְ → "tidak ada raja": source=[einId], target=["tidak", "ada"] —
  both primary; source=[melekId], target=["raja"] — primary 1:1.
  Pronominal suffixes on אֵין (e.g., אֵינֶנּוּ) → suffix word-part fuses per PRONOMINAL
  SUFFIXES.

No discontiguous-verb caveat is needed — Indonesian "tidak"/"jangan" always sits directly
before the verb, so the negation record and the verb record never interleave the way
French's ne...pas does.

---

## PARTICIPIAL CONSTRUCTIONS **[ind]**

- **Adjectival:** align to Indonesian adjective or participial modifier — primary.

- **Substantive with article word-part:** article → generic head noun "orang"/
  "orang-orang" primary 1:1 WHEN the translation supplies an explicit head noun; "yang"
  secondary to the participle. When the translation uses bare "yang" with no separate
  head noun, the article has no target correspondent at all (Branch B, absorbed) —
  "yang" remains secondary to the participle regardless.
  Example: הַשֹּׁמֵר → "orang yang menjaga": source=[articlePart], target=["orang"] —
  primary 1:1; source=[participleId], target=["yang", "menjaga"] — primary: "menjaga";
  secondary: "yang".
  Bare form, no head noun: שֹׁמֵר (anarthrous) → "yang menjaga": source has no article
  token; source=[participleId], target=["yang", "menjaga"] — primary: "menjaga";
  secondary: "yang".

- **Verbal (predicative):** Indonesian aspect auxiliary ("sedang"/"telah"/"sudah")
  secondary; main verbal element primary.
  Example: יֹשֵׁב → "sedang duduk": source=[participleId], target=["sedang", "duduk"] —
  primary: "duduk"; secondary: "sedang".

- **Periphrastic (participle + explicit הָיָה):** הָיָה → Indonesian existential/copula
  auxiliary ("ada"/"telah"), separate primary record; participle → main verb, primary.
  source=[hayahId], target=["telah"] — primary 1:1;
  source=[participleId], target=["duduk"] — primary 1:1.

---

## INFINITIVAL CONSTRUCTIONS **[ind]**

### Infinitive construct with לְ

Indonesian has no distinct infinitive form or marker (unlike English "to") — the
ordinary verb is primary alone, whether or not לְ is present as a separate word-part.
Example: רָצָה לָלֶכֶת → "ingin pergi": source=[verbPart], target=["pergi"] — primary 1:1
(no "to"-equivalent secondary).

Purposive לְ with a distinct correspondent → "untuk" primary to the preposition
word-part; infinitive primary to the verb.
Example: הֵחֵל לְדַבֵּר → "mulai untuk berbicara": source=[lePrepPart], target=["untuk"] —
primary; source=[verbPart], target=["berbicara"] — primary.

### Purpose/temporal constructions (בְּ/לְ + infinitive) → finite clause, not a nonfinite form

Indonesian has no participle or gerund-like nonfinite form for this construction.
Hebrew's בְּ + infinitive ("while/when X-ing") instead renders as an ordinary finite
clause introduced by "ketika"/"saat"/"waktu" (when/while) — the same mechanism NT
Indonesian uses for ἐν τῷ + infinitive. Treat the preposition word-part as the
correspondent to the conjunction, primary; supplied subject pronoun secondary to the
verb per TOKEN ROLES.
Example: בְּשָׁמְעוֹ → "ketika ia mendengar":
source=[bePrepPart], target=["ketika"] — primary;
source=[sufPart], target=["ia"] — primary (suffix marks the subject; fuses only when
attached directly to a noun/preposition/verb as a clitic — here it surfaces as an
independent pronoun since Indonesian finite clauses take a free-standing subject);
source=[verbPart], target=["mendengar"] — primary.

### Infinitive absolute (cognate emphasis)

Infinitive absolute → Indonesian emphasis word ("sungguh"/"pasti"): primary 1:1. Finite
verb → main Indonesian verb: primary.
Example: מוֹת תָּמוּת → "engkau pasti akan mati":
source=[infAbsId], target=["pasti"] — primary 1:1;
source=[verbId], target=["engkau", "akan", "mati"] — primary: "mati"; secondary:
"engkau", "akan".
Absorbed without separate Indonesian word → infinitive absolute secondary to finite
verb, or NEQ if definitively untranslated.
